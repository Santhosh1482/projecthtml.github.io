            <h1>Features of Java Explained</h1>
        </center>
        <center><font face="Times New Roman" size="4px"><p>
            The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, and scalability. <br>
            Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main factors in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust <br> 
            type system and allows automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in support for multithreading and security features. <br>
            In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use. <br>

            Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and <br>
            adaptability, which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike. <br>

            Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated applications. There are many useful classes and functions in <br>
            Java’s standard library, and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more capability.

        <center><h1>What is Data Structure and Algorithm?</h1></center>
        <center>
            <font face="Times New Roman" size="4px"><p>
                You may already know that computers are used to store and modify massive amounts of data. Data structures are used to efficiently and conveniently arrange and store data. <br>
                Organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used effectively is known as a data structure.In addition to defining the relationships between <br>
                data pieces, it offers a means of representing and storing data. Common data structures include trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, arrays, and stacks. <br><br>

                Now, an algorithm is a set of guidelines or procedures used to complete a task or solve a problem.To get a certain outcome, algorithms are used to alter data that is <br>
                stored in data structures. Data in an array or linked list can be sorted using a sorting algorithm, for instance. <br><br>

                Data structures and algorithms are closely associated in computer science because an algorithm’s effectiveness frequently depends on the selection of an effective data structure. <br>
                An algorithm can become more effective and quick with the right data format. For instance, a hash table is a popular data structure for quick data retrieval and searching. <br><br>

            <h1>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1>
            <font face="Times New Roman" size="4px" >
                <p>A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, <br> 
                    such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others. <br> <br>

                    Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project. <br><br>
                    
                    In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage <br> 
                    front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development process.</p> <br>
